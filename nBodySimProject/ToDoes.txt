What should be done for a correct simulation:

For some reason, the total energy is not conserved enough. It is conserving but, has too much up and downs.
-> Why? Try different leap-frog calculation order, like first update position to x_(i+1/2), calculate there a(i+1/2), or update the velocity first? I saw different approaches in the internet. If nothing works try verlet algo.
 
Make a window with bars to choose what to simulate
 -> I implemented different simulation options, but no textbar to choose
 
-> if number of particles is changing update plummer
--> Idea: not for every particle, but for 10-20% changes in the number


Nice to have:

- Barnes-Hut
- Threading

Options:

- Colors and effects (e.g. kinetic energy colors)
- merges

Beneficial plotting command text:
plot 'test.txt' using 0:1 with lines title 'Ekin', 'test.txt' using 0:2 with lines title 'Epot', 'test.txt' using 0:3 with lines title 'Etot', 'test.txt' using 0:4 with lines title 'Etot2'
