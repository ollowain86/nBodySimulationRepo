What should be done for a correct simulation:

- Plummerradius calculation with https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikibooks/de/f/fd/MehrkoerperproblemInDerAstronomie.pdf - Page 107
 I find out: Plummerradius = R/N, where R ist the radius of the total system and N the number of particles.
 I found out to implement a smoothing function u^2(r) to multiply with the plummer radius, page 104 ff. which works between 0 and 2*plummer.
 
 -> DONE

Or more complex (will not do)
- Dynamic time steps Page 113
-- Rendering every "x" time units (ask GPT)

Nice to have:

- Barnes-Hut
- Threading

Options:

- Colors and effects (e.g. kinetic energy colors)
- Different options to simulate (Solar system, global potential for galactic simulation, globular cluster)
- merges
