What should be done for a correct simulation:

- Plummerradius calculation with https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikibooks/de/f/fd/MehrkoerperproblemInDerAstronomie.pdf - Page 107
 I find out: Plummerradius = R/N, where R ist the radius of the total system and N the number of particles.
 I found out to implement a smoothing function u^2(r) to multiply with the plummer radius, page 104 ff. which works between 0 and 2*plummer.
 
 -> DONE
 
Test if forces are calculated correctly, especially for the plummer radius -> DONE with excel
Make a window with bars to choose what to simulate
 -> include globular cluster, which should be in a circular shape
 -> make several globular clusters
 -> make a one with a global potential in a circular shape
 -> make a solar system
 -> make a heavy point mass moving, accompaied by sattelites
 
-> if number of particles is changing update plummer
--> Idea: not for every particle, but for 10-20% changes in the number


Nice to have:

- Barnes-Hut
- Threading

Options:

- Colors and effects (e.g. kinetic energy colors)
- Different options to simulate (Solar system, global potential for galactic simulation, globular cluster)
- merges

Beneficial:
